# Structure and Requirements


_Key Constraints_:

- 225 minutes
- Intro to python and data analysis for social science audience

_Lesson Plan_:

Block 1: Before we start coding\
- About me (5 min)
- Learning objectives (5 min)
- Coding for research? (10 min)
- Tools/what's what (20 min)

Block 2: Base Python\
- Assignment (`=`)
- Data types: (`str`, `int`, `bool`, `float`)
- Data structures: (`list`, `dict`)
	- Accessing elements of structures
- Iteration: `for`
- Functions
- Classes?

Block 3: Data Analysis\
- Tabular data
- Reading/writing data
- Selecting data
- Operations on tabular data
- Combining tabular data
- Presenting data


# Part 0: Pre-Lesson

## About Me

## Learning Objectives

1. What is Python? How do I use it for research? Why would I use it for research?
2. Base Python. Fundamental structures for all applications
3. Data Analysis. Engaging with data using Pandas


## Part 1: Conceptual Grounding

- Many participants have some experience coding (what are they looking for in an Intro Python course?)
- Keep this part short, try to get people on the same page about _what_ we are trying to learn.


**Automation and Scale (in Social Science Research)**

- Why learn Python (as a social science researcher)?
	- Tool for automationâ€“applies to many things.
	- Studying phenomena _at scale_
	- Augment/alter how you engage with _data_.

**"Coding" and "Development"**: Tools 

- Akin to learning to operate specialized machinery
- Also akin to learning to operate machine for creating other machines


# Base Python

- Assignment (`=`)
- Data types: (`str`, `int`, `bool`, `float`)
- Data structures: (`list`, `dict`)
	- Accessing elements of structures
- Iteration: `for`
- Functions
- Classes?

## Variable Assignment

We assign _values_ to _variables_ using the `=` operator.

```{python}
